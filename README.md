# Overloading
Simple program on Overloading (Method/Constructor)
In Java it is Possible to define 2/more methods/constructors within the same class that share the same name but parameter declarations are different.
Any method/constructor are identified by return type, number of parameters, and parameter order.
Method return type don't play any role for Overload resolution.
